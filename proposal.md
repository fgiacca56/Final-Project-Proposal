# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

FJFitFam

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An app that tells you how much you should be eating based off of your weight, activity level, and height.  

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

So, this project is designed to help you lose or gain weight depending on the users choice.  The user will input their weight,
height, activity level, and from this information, we will be able to determine what their calories are and how much water they need along with their macros.  This will be executed using multiple functions to determine the users information then followed by if statements to determine their calories and water intake per day.  


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will definitely accomplish the input part.  Allowing the user to input his or her information is a big part of our project.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?


A better outcome will be completing the input stage along with finding the calories and water intake per day based off of the users choice of whether he wants to lose or gain weight.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to have the input stage, determining the calories and water intake, and calculating the macros: proteins, carbs, and fats.  

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Joe and I plan on working on this project after finishing our third paper for English.  Most of the concepts we are using in this project Joe and I have great confidence with.  We will work on it together on discord, but I will be in charge of the input statements while Joe researches the equation for the calories.  We will both work on the body part of our project.
